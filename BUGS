	How to report bugs
	==================

Point your browser to http://bugzilla.aspseek.org/ and follow "Enter a new
bug report" link. Register if you have not done it yet.

While filling in the bug report form, do not forget to choose a version
of ASPseek and an appropriate component.

Please provide all necessary information in the bug description. Just
telling "I can't use your program" or "index dumps core" is not enough.

Check that you have included at least:

* operating system name and version;
* versions of C++ compiler, standard libraries, make utility, SQL server;
* some notes about SQL server configuration if it differs from default;
* appropriate configuration files or relevant fragments;
* URLs which you've tried to index if it is accessible from Internet,
  or some idea of what data do you have there if it's in your local intranet;
* some hardware details, like CPU, memory, disks information - all that affects
  speed and portability.
