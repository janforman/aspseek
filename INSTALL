ASPseek installation, run-time configuration and troubleshooting.


Quick install
=============
For the impatient, here's what you need to do (please read Step-by-step install
below for more information):

* Install the appropriate RDBMS if you haven't done so.
* Run './configure && make'.
* Run 'make install' as root.
* Create aspseek user ('adduser aspseek' or something like that).
* Create new user, database and needed SQL tables in RDBMS (if you use MySQL,
  run script named aspseek-mysql-postinstall, it should create all that).
* Read and edit configuration files in etc installation directory.
* Run sbin/index as aspseek user, wait for it to finish.
* Run sbin/searchd -D as aspseek user.
* Put s.cgi to your Web server's cgi-bin.
* Put images from etc/img to /img dir under your web server document root
* Run sbin/index on a regular basis to update database.
* Open http://localhost/cgi-bin/s.cgi and do the search!


Upgrade
=======

If you are upgrading from 1.2.9, please run index -H after upgrading
to re-create citation index files. Note that this is time-consuming
process, do not interrupt it! Alternatively, you can clear the whole
database by running index -C, and reindex everything all over again.

If you are upgrading from 1.2.8 or earlier versions, please note the
following:

1). If you had many sites and re-indexed them, please run index -H to
re-create citation index files.

2). If you have used "Cache" feature, please rename the SQL table "cache"
to "rescache". This is done with "ALTER TABLE cache RENAME TO rescache"
SQL statement.

If you are upgrading from 1.1.x, there's nothing special to be done, just
install over the old binaries, your configuration will be preserved. After
that, restart searchd.

If you are upgrading from 1.0.x, please note that default database format
is incompatible with one of 1.0.x versions, because of new (better)
storage modes and UNICODE support. So, while upgrading you basically have
two options:

1. (preferred) Delete SQL database content and even SQL tables itself, recreate
it from etc/your_dbms/tables.sql, delete aspseek/var contents and re-index
everything all over again.

2. Use options --disable-fast-clones --disable-unicode to configure, and set
"CompactStorage no" and "IncrementalCitations no" in both aspseek.conf and
searchd.conf.
Update: seems that ASPseek no longer works with --disable-unicode, and we
(developers) see no reasons to fix it. So, just don't use it, it is deprecated.


Please DON'T FORGET to upgrade s.cgi in your web server cgi-bin directory, as
old s.cgi will not understand new searchd and can just stay in infinite idle
loop or produce incorrect results.


Step-by-step install
====================


1. System requirements
----------------------

We use ASPLinux distribution (http://www.asp-linux.com), which is RedHat
compatible, to develop and run ASPseek, but is should run on (or be easy to
port to - due to autoconf) other UNIX variants. At the moment the following
platforms are supported:

	Linux 2.x
	FreeBSD 4.x

Please report your success with other platforms to aseek@sw.com.sg.

You also need RDBMS. MySQL 3.23 or later, or Oracle 8.1.5 or later are
supported in this version. Support for more databases is planned for
future releases.

To build binaries, you need decent C++ compiler (we use GNU g++), STL library
(we use one from libg++) and GNU make utility (non-GNU make can fail to work).

NOTE for RedHat users: egcs from RedHat 6.0 and 6.1 are _broken_ and can't
compile ASPseek sources correctly. Either upgrade egcs and libstdc++ to ones
from RedHat 6.2, or compile without -O2 (type export CXXFLAGS="-O0" before
./configure).


2. Getting the sources
----------------------

You can always get the sources of latest ASPseek release from
http://www.aspseek.org/sources.html. Download the source and untar it
by running

gzip -dc aspseek-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xf -

or, if you have GNU tar,

tar xzf aspseek-x.y.z.tar.gz


If you are curious and want to stay at the bleeding edge, you can get the
latest development sources from anonymous CVS.

To get the sources from CVS, you should use the following commands:
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@www.asplinux.ru:/home/cvs
cvs login [Here you should type the password: anoncvs]
cvs co aspseek
cvs logout

Next time, you do not need to run "cvs co aspseek" as the sources are already
on your machine; just run "cvs update aspseek" instead.

After fetching the sources from CVS, please run script ./cvsprep. You need
to have some tools installed, notably autoconf, automake and libtool.

PLEASE NOTE that if you use version from CVS, it may be unstable and maybe
will not compile at all. So you should know what you are doing.

CVS is also available for your viewing pleasure via Web at
http://www.asplinux.ru/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/aspseek/


3. Configuration
----------------

cd aspseek-x.y.z
./configure --your-options

For example, to specify your non-standard MySQL location, add
--with-mysql=/path/to/mysql. To specify ASPseek installation directory
(instead of standard /usr/local/aspseek), add --prefix=/some/dir.

If you need https:// support, please use --with-openssl flag. This will need
OpenSSL (available from http://www.openssl.org) installed. If you have OpenSSL
installed to non-standard location (say, /usr/ssl), use
--with-openssl=/usr/ssl flag to configure.

Run ./configure --help to see all available configure options.


4. Compilation and installation
-------------------------------

Just run make && make install. On non-Linux systems, you should run GNU make
instead, it is often installed as gmake.


5. Run-time configuration
-------------------------

First, you should create RDMBS user, database and all needed SQL tables.
See your RDBMS manual for details.

In case of MySQL, you can use aspseek-mysql-postinstall script provided
for your convenience. It should create all needed SQL stuff for you.

Then,
cd /usr/local/aspseek (or directory you have just installed ASPseek to)
cd etc

Two main configuration files are aspseek.conf and searchd.conf. You should
edit these files manually and provide all necessary information such as
RDBMS user name, password and database name, what sites do you want to
index and how often etc. There are a lot of comments in the files
so just read-and-modify. Also, aspseek.conf(5) and searchd.conf(5) man
pages should be helpful.

If you want ASPseek to search documents which contains information not only
in English, look at ucharset.conf and stopwords.conf, there you should
uncomment all needed charsets and stopword files.

There is also a template file s.htm, which is used by search front-end s.cgi.
It tells how search forms and results should be displayed. For the first
time default template will work for you, but if you want to modify it,
read man page s.htm(5) for in-depth explanation.


6. First indexing
-----------------

Just run sbin/index. It will crawl the sites you put to aspseek.conf
and put resulting data in SQL tables and in var/ directory of ASPseek
installation.

If you are indexing more than one server, flags -N and -R should be very
useful.

-N <num> sets the number of indexing threads (default is 1), and
-R <num> sets the number of resolvers (default is NUM_THREADS/5 + 1)

Setting number of indexing threads to more than a number of servers indexed
makes no sense, because index gets one document at a time from one server.

For other index flags, see index(1) man page.


7. First searching
------------------

First, you should run sbin/searchd -D as aspseek user. This is search daemon,
which provides interface to database, does actual search, caches search
results and so on.

Copy image files from etc/img installation directory to /img directory
under your web server document root.

Copy bin/s.cgi to your Web server cgi-bin directory and point your browser
to it. You should see the search form.

We will be happy to see a report about successful installation from you, so
please send one to <aseek@sw.com.sg>.


8. Further reading
------------------

Please read manual pages (starting from introductory aspseek(7) man page)
and various files in doc/ subdirectory. Manual pages are also available online
at http://www.aspseek.org/manual.html. All configuration files are heavily
self-documented too.
