ASPseek Apache module, by Ivan Gudym (ignite@ukr.net)

1.Installation

Configure ASPseek to support Apache module, this is done by passing
--enable-apache-module flag to configure script. After that do regular
"make" to create binaries. In addition to "index", "searchd' and "s.cgi",
"mod_aspseek.so" shared library will be created. Do "make install" as usual,
and module will be installed to the appropriate place. Then, you need to
activate the module in httpd.conf file, this is done by adding the lines
like these:

LoadModule aspseek_module       modules/mod_aspseek.so
AddModule mod_aspseek.c
<IfModule mod_aspseek.c>
    <Location /aspseek>
		SetHandler aspseek
		ASPseekTemplate /usr/local/aspseek/etc/s.htm
    </Location>
</IfModule>

ASPseekTemplate configuration directive can be placed outside 'Directory'
or 'Location' scope - to specify server-wide template, or inside them - to
specify location specific template. Please make sure that the user under
which apache daemon is running have access to that file.

Restart Apache by '/etc/init.d/httpd restart' and try aspseek module by
typing 'http://localhost/aspseek/' in your browser.

2. Benchmark
I am interesting, is it useful to have Apache module rather then CGI
program. So I perform two simple tests with 'ab' program from Apache
distribution. One to send 100 requests with concurrent 10 of it, and
second - 1000 requests with concurrent 100. Here command strings:
1)	/usr/sbin/ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost/aspseek?q=www
	/usr/sbin/ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost/cgi-bin/s.cgi?q=www
2)	/usr/sbin/ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost/aspseek?q=www
	/usr/sbin/ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost/cgi-bin/s.cgi?q=www

In my Red Hat 7.0 on Celeron 667 with 128 RAM I took such results:
1)
	| Mod	| CGI	| Diff,%
--------+-------+-------+----------
Time,s	| 28.8	| 33.9	| 15%
Req/s	| 3.47	| 2.94	|

2)
	| Mod	| CGI	| Diff,%
--------+-------+-------+----------
Time,s	| 268.3	| 538.2	| 51%
Req/s	| 3.73	| 1.86	|

In addition, while performing second test for CGI, one s.cgi process was
killed by kernel.

So resume: in low load it is efficient and more safe to use CGI program,
in heavy load better choice is the Apache module.
