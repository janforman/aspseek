Latest ASPseek RPMs are available at http://www.aspseek.org/pkg/rpm/

	Requirements
	------------

Before installing ASPseek from RPMs, you need the following packages
to be installed:

1. MySQL 3.23.xx or later version
2. Apache (or some other web server which supports CGI)
3. zlib

	Installation
	------------

First, you need to install database back-end. Name of RPM file is
aspseek-YOUR_DBMS-lib-*.rpm, there YOUR_DBMS is
name of the DBMS (currently, back-end for MySQL 3.23 (mysql) is available).

# rpm -i aspseek-mysql-lib-*.rpm

If post-install script failed (you will see appropriate message), that means
that you have probably set MySQL root password. So, you need to run this
script (/usr/bin/aspseek-mysql-postinstall) again, giving MySQL root password
as an argument. If you upgrade from earlier version, just ignore the error.

When, you need to install "main" aspseek rpm.

# rpm -i aspseek-*.rpm

There shouldn't be any errors during installation.

Next, you should install search client. Currently there is a choice
between CGI binary and module for Apache web server. Both clients use
aspseek client library and configuration files provided by
aspseek-client rpm.

If you want to use CGI, install the following packages:

# rpm -i aspseek-client-*.rpm aspseek-cgi-*.rpm

If you want to use Apache module, install the following packages:

# rpm -i aspseek-client-*.rpm mod_aspseek-*.rpm

Actually, you can install and use both clients simultaneously.

	Configuration
	-------------

Look at /etc/aspseek directory - there are many configuration files in it.
Main files are aspseek.conf (where you can set at least what sites do you
want to index), searchd.conf (configuration of search daemon) and s.htm
(where you can control how the search output will look like). Default settings
let you to index and search http://localhost/. Most likely you want to change
http://localhost/ to site(s) you actually want to index; for this, edit
/etc/aspseek/aspseek.conf file.

	First run
	---------

Become root and run '/etc/init.d/aspseek' start command. This will start
search daemon. Then do 'su aspseek' (to become aspseek user) and run "index".
After it will finish, open your browser and open URL
http://yourhost.com/cgi-bin/s.cgi.

	Further reading
	---------------

Read the documents provided with the package (which gets installed into
/usr/share/doc/aspseek*/) and configuration files in /etc/aspseek (which are
self-documented with many inlined comments). There are also a set of manual
pages available: aspseek(7), index(1), searchd(1), s.cgi(1), aspseek.conf(5),
searchd.conf(5), s.htm(5) and aspseek-sql(5).
