If you want to contribute to the package, please follow these guidelines
while writing code:

0. Use comments (see details below).
1. Use "new" and "delete" operators instead of "free" and "malloc" functions.
2. Put open bracket "{" to the next line after "if", "do", "while"....
3. Member variables should start with "m_".
4. Class names should start with uppercased C; every word in class and member
   function names should be uppercased (ex.: CAwaySender::GetLostBuddy())
5. Put one space after keywords and commas. Put spaces around operators.
6. Each line of function body, including variables declarations, should 
   be indented by tabulation (and should NOT be started at the same position
   as body opening bracket)

If you like to send a patch, please generate a unified diff (diff -u) file
and clearly state against which version your patch is.

While writing your comments, please honor doxygen style (see
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html). That specifically
means, that if you want to document class or member, put the comment just
before it's definition, and add one extra slash or asterisk. If you want to
put comment at the same line as definition, additionally put "less then" sign.

Comments in code should be done as usual, they do not needed for docs, just
for code readers.

Here's an example:

/** Here goes brief one-line class description.
    And this is longer class description, with
    all the gory details included.
*/
class CAwaySender
{
private:
	int m_known;	///< Counts known visitors
	/// Counts unknown visitors
	int m_unknown;
public:
	/// Default constructor
	void CAwaySender(void): m_known(0), m_unknown(0) {}
	/// Say goodbye to one that we don't like. v is reference to visitor
	void SayGoodBye(CVisitor& v);
	/** This is more rude way to do the same as SayGoodBye does */
	void GetLostBuddy(CVisitor& v);
	void CheckVisitor(CVisitor& v) ///< Checks visitor and kicks him off
	{
		// in this version we assume that all visitors are unknown
		m_unknown++; // count it
		/* yes, we ARE rude */
		GetLostBuddy(v);
	}
};
