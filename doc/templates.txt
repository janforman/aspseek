ASPseek users have an ability to customize the search results (output of
s.cgi). You may do it by providing template file s.htm, which should be located
in etc/ directory of ASPseek installation.

Template file is like a plain HTML file, which is divided into sections.
Keep in mind that you can just open template file in your favorite browser
and get the idea of how the search results will look like.

Each section begins with <!--sectionname--> and ends with <!--/sectionname-->
delimiters, which should reside on a separate line.

Each section consists of HTML formatted text with special meta symbols. Meta
symbol is one- or two-letter name with the preceding $ sign (examples: $DX,
$V). Every meta symbol is replaced by it's corresponding string. You can think
of meta symbols as of variables, which will have their appropriate values while
displaying the search results.

The following section names are defined:


top	This section is included first on every page. You should begin this
        section	with <HTML><HEAD> and so on. Also, this is a definitive place
	to provide a search form. There are some special meta symbols you
	may use in this section:
	    $A  Argument for FORM ACTION tag with host name and protocol
		(like http://www.aspseek.com/cgi-bin/s.cgi)
            $QF Your escaped query concatenated with previous query
                if search was made within results
            $q - your query concatenated with previous query if search was
                made within results, escaped only in
                "res*" sections
	    $rN Random number (here N is a number)

	If you want to include some random banners on your pages, please use
	$rN. You should also place string like RN=xxxx in 'variables' section
	(see below), which will give you a range 0..xxxx for $rN.
	You can use up to MAXRANDOM numbers as N (defined in search.h, default
	is 128). Example: $r0, $r1, $r45 etc.

	Simple top section should be like this:

<!--top-->
<HTML>
<HEAD>
 <TITLE>ASPseek: $Q</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<A HREF="http://www.yourbannersite.com/ads.pl?advert=NonSSI&page=$r0">
<IMG SRC="http://www.yourbannersite.com/ads.pl?ID=your_id&page=$r0"
HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=468 BORDER=0></A>

<FORM METHOD=GET ACTION="$A">
 <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="ul" VALUE="">
 <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="ps" VALUE="20">
 Search for: <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="q" SIZE=30 VALUE="$Q">
 <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Search!"><BR>
</FORM>
<!--/top-->

You can see some variables defined in FORM.
ul is the filter for URL (so you can limit results to particular site etc..
And you can use multiple filters delimited by exactly one space).
ps is default page size (e.g. how many documents to display per page).
q is the query itself.
spN where N is web space ID (sp1, sp2...) can be set to "on" or "off".
If all of these variables are set to "off", then search is performed in the
whole database.
gr can be set to "off" to turn off grouping results by sites.

bottom	This section is always included last in every page. So you should
	provide all closing tags, which have their counterparts in top section.
	Although it is not obligatory to place this section at the end of
	template file, but doing so will help you to view your template as an
	ordinary html file in a browser to get the idea how it is look like.
	
	Below is an example of bottom section:

<!--bottom-->
<P>
<HR>
<DIV ALIGN=right><a href="http://www.aspstreet.com/"></A>
</BODY>
</HTML>
<!--/bottom-->


restop	This section is included just before the search results. It's not a bad
	idea to provide some common search results. You can do so by using the
	following meta symbols:
	    $f - number of First document displayed on this page
	    $l - number of Last document displayed on this page
	    $t - Total number of found documents
	    $W - information about the number of word forms found
	         (e.g. if your query was 'html template' $W can be something
		 like 'html: 10/20  template: 20/30' where first number
		 is the URL count and second number is the total count)
	    $Y	 Total time spent to perform query.

	Below is an example of 'restop' section:

<!--restop-->
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100%>
<TR>
<TD><small>Matches $f-$l of total <B>$t</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;                         
Search took $Y seconds.</TD>
<TD><small>$W</small></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<!--/restop-->


res and res2
	These sections are used for displaying various information about every
	found document. The following meta symbols are used:
	    $DU  Document URL
	    $DE  Escaped document URL (useful for building "cached link")
	    $DT  Document Title
	    $DR  Document Rating (as calculated by ASPseek)
	    $DX  Document teXt (Several excerpts from URL content or 
		 the first couple of lines to give an idea of what
		 the document is about in case when excerpts not found
		 or MaxExcerpts parameter is set to 0).
	    $DC  Document Content-type (for example, text/html)
	    $DM  Document Last-Modified date
	    $DS  Document Size (in bytes)
	    $DB  Document Size (in kilobytes)
	    $DZ  Prints template "sizeb" if document size is less than 1024,
		 otherwise prints template "sizek"
	    $DN  Document Number (in order of appearance)
	    $DD  Document Description (from META DESCRIPTION tag)
	    $DK  Document Keywords (from META KEYWORDS tag)
	    $CC  "Óached" template if document is text/html or text/plain,
	         or "textversion" template, if document was converted
		 from other format
	    $CL  Clone List (see section 'clone' for details)
	
	res is used to display first document for each found site
	or for all documents is only 1 site is found.
	res2 is used to display second document for each site
	if more than 1 site is found.
	Here is an example of res section:

<!--res-->
<DL><DT>
<b>$DN.</b><a href="$DU" TARGET="_blank"><b>$DT</b></a> [<b>$DR</b>]<DD>
$DX...<BR>
<b>URL: </b><A HREF="$DU" TARGET="_blank">$DU</A>($DC)<BR>
$DM, $DS bytes<BR>
<b>Description: </b>$DD<br>
<b>Keywords: </b>$DK<br>
</DL>
<UL>
$CL
</UL>
<!--/res-->


clone	The contents of this section is included in result just instead of
	$CL meta symbol for every document clone found. This is used to
	provide all URLs with the same contents (like mirrors etc.).
	You can use the same $D* meta symbols here as in 'res' section. Of
	course, some information about clone, like $DS, $DR, DX will be the
	same so it is of little use to place it here.

	Below is an example of 'clone' section.

<!--clone-->
<li><A HREF="$DU" TARGET="_blank">$DU</A> ($DC) $DM
<!--/clone-->

resbot	This is included just after last 'res' section. You usually give a
	navigation bar here to allow user go to next/previous results page.
	The meta chars used are:
	    $V - naVigator (links to previous/next pages)
	    $w - Prints "inres" template if more than one result is found,
	         "inres" template should define either checkbox 
	         "Search in results" or link to "search in results" page.

Navigator is constructed from the following templates:

Previous page: Printed if current page > 0
<!--navleft-->
<TD><A HREF="$NH"><IMG...></A><BR><A HREF="$NH">Prev</A></TD>
<!--/navleft-->

Previous page: Printed if current page == 0
<!--navleft0-->
<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<!--/navleft0-->

Current Page:
<!--navbar0-->
<TD><IMG...></A><BR>$NN</TD>
<!--navbar0-->

Next Page: Printed if there is a next page only
<!--navright-->
<TD><A HREF="$NH"><IMG...></A><BR><A HREF="$NH">Next</A></TD>
<!--navright-->

Next Page: Printed if there is no next page only
<!--navright0-->
<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<!--navright0-->

Middle pages in navigation bar:
<!--navbar1-->
<TD><A HREF="$HR"><IMG...></A><BR><A HREF="$NH">$NN</A></TD>
<!--/navbar1-->


This is the sample of navigator:

<!--navigator-->
<TABLE BORDER=0><TR>$NL $NB $NR</TR></TABLE>
<!--/navigator-->

	This is an example of 'resbot' section:

<!--resbot-->                                                                   
<HR>                                                                            
<CENTER>$V</CENTER>
<!--/resbot-->

notfound
	As its name implies, this section is displayed in case when
	no documents are found. You usually give a little message saying that
	and maybe some hints how to make search less restrictive.

	Below is an example of notfound section:

<!--notfound-->
<CENTER>
Sorry, but search hasn't returned results.<P>
<I>Try to produce less restrictive search query or check words spelling</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<!--/notfound-->


error	This section is displayed in case some internal error occurred while
	searching. For example, database server is not running or so.
	You may provide next meta symbol:
	    $E - Error text

	Example of error section:

<!--error-->
<CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">An error occurred!</FONT>
<P>
<B>$E</B>
</CENTER>
<!--/error-->

queryerror
	This section is displayed in case if query contains error
	like unmatched quote or parenthesis.
	    $E  Error text

	Example of error section:

<!--queryerror-->
<CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Error in query: $E</FONT>
<P>
<B>$E</B>
</CENTER>
<!--/queryerror-->

complexPhrase
	This section is displayed in case if boolean expression
	is used inside phrase. Intended just to warn user.

complexExpression
	This section is displayed in case if boolean expression
	is used in query

moreurls
	This section is displayed, when more than 1 or 2 URLs is found
	on particular site. It is displayed in result just instead of
	$M2, $M1 or $M meta symbols.

	Example of moreurls section:

<!--moreurls-->
<small><A HREF="$SH"><b>More from site</b></A>
<A HREF="$SS" TARGET="_blank">$SS</A> ($SC documents)</small>
<!--/moreurls-->

	The following meta symbols are used:
	    $SH  URL to get more results from this site.
	    $SS  URL of home page of this site.
	    $SC	 Number of documents found on this site.



include
	If line <!--include filename --> is encountered, then ASPseek starts
	loading template definitions from file, specified by "filename",
	then resumes processing of current file.
	Example of use: if two or more template definitions differ only
	in "top" and "bottom" sections, then create one file with sections
	other than "top" and "bottom", then create two different files with
	"top" and "bottom" sections and put "<!--include first_name -->"
	to both of these files.

ressites
	This section is displayed in case if more than one site is found
	It is displayed in result just instead of $R meta symbol.

	Example of this section:

<!--ressites-->
Displaying sites $f-$l of total <B>$t</B> found.
<!--/ressites-->


resurls
	This section is displayed in case if only 1 site is found.
	It is displayed in result just instead of $R meta symbol.

	Example of resurls section:

<!--resurls-->
Displaying documents $f-$l of total <B>$t</B> found on site $SS.
<!--/resurls-->


User defined template

ASPseek treats lines <!--name--> as start of user defined template
and <!--/name--> as end of user defined template. Name of user
defined template must begin with alphanumeric character, otherwise
this line is treated as regular HTML comment belonging to the current
template. So it is important to put space after "<!--" in comments.
User defined templates can be used from other templates using $Tname
meta symbols, where "name" is the name of user defined template.

	Example of using user defined template:

<!-- res0 is the user defined template-->
<!--res0-->
<a href="$DU" TARGET="_blank"><b>$DT</b></a> [$DR]<br>
$DX<BR>
<small class="gr"><!-- <A HREF="$DU" TARGET="_blank"> -->$DU<!-- </A> -->
<!-- ($DC)  $DM,--> $DS bytes <A HREF="$A?ch=$DU"> Cached </A> </small>
$CL
<!--/res0-->

<!--res-->		<!-- first result from site-->
<br>
<b>$DN.</b>
$Tres0			<!-- print user defined template-->
<br>
<!--/res-->

<!--res2-->		<!-- second result from site, display it indented -->
<BLOCKQUOTE>
$Tres0			<!-- print user defined template-->
<br>
$M2				<!-- print "moreurls" template-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--/res2-->


The following section names are used to customize appearance of "cached" pages

cachetop
	This section is included first on every "cached" page.
	The following meta symbols are used:
	    $DU  Document URL

hiopen
hiexopen
	These sections are inserted before search term, which should be
	highlighted (hiopen is used in cached copy, and hiexopen is used in
	excerpts). The following meta symbols are used:
	    $H  String value of color to highlight, taken from "hicolors"
                section.

hiclose
hiexclose
	These sections are inserted after search term, which should be
	highlighted.

hicolors
	Each line of this section should contain value of color for each search
	term. Value of color is taken from line with number equal to N mod C,
	where N is the search term sequential number and C is the total number
	of lines in this section.


There is also a special variables section, in which you can set up 
some values for search.

Special variables section usually looks like this:

<!--variables
LocalCharset iso-8851-1
# DaemonAddress is the IP address and port of search daemon delimited by colon.
DaemonAddress 1.1.1.1:12345
# MaxExcerpts is the maximum number of excerpts from original URL content,
# which displayed for each result.
MaxExcerpts 2
-->
