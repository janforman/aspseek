This is directory with stopwords file for different languages.

To make ASPseek use stopwords, add appropriate StopwordFile directives to your
stopwords.conf file (which is included by both aspseek.conf and searchd.conf).

If you can't find your language here, you are welcome to create one and send it
to aseek@sw.com.sg, so we will include it in next ASPseek version. Format is
simple - one stopword per line, lines started with # are comments. If you have
several charsets for your language, please note the charset used in file.

Please take into account that stopword length is limited to 15 bytes now. This
is more than enough, since stopwords are short anyway.
