.SH NAME
aspseek.conf \- index configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@sysconfdir@/aspseek.conf\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaspseek.conf\fR is a configuration file for \fBindex\fR(1). It completely
defines all the aspects of ASPseek indexing process - what to index and how
to do it.
.P
The following can be defined:
.SS General
.TP
\fBDBAddr\fR \fBDBType\fR:[//[\fBUser\fR[:\fBPass\fR]@]\fBHost\fR[:\fBPort\fR]]/\fBDBName\fR/
Defines SQL server connection parameters.
.br
\fBDBType\fR is SQL server type, it can be \fImysql\fR or \fIoracle8\fR
for now.
.br
\fBUser\fR is a SQL server's user to connect as.
.br
\fBPass\fR is a \fBUser\fR's password. If this field is omitted,
no password is used.
.br
\fBHost\fR is a host name or IP address of host to connect to. If you
are running SQL server on the same machine, use \fIlocalhost\fR.
.br
\fBPort\fR is a port number on which SQL server is listening at.
Default is the same as default port of used SQL server.
.br
\fBDBName\fR is a name of the database used.
.TP
\fBDBLibDir\fR \fI/some/dir\fR
Adds \fI/some/dir\fR to list of directories to search for database
backend library (lib\fIdbname\fR-\fIversion\fR.so).
Default library search path is
\fB\f(CW@libdir@\fR. Several such options can be used, each adding
one more directory to the list. Last added directory is used first;
compiled in path is last.
.TP
\fBDataDir\fR \fI /some/dir
Sets directory in which delta files and files with information
about words, subsets, spaces will be stored. Default is
\fB\f(CW@localstatedir@\fR.
.TP
\fBDebugLevel\fR \fInone\fR | \fIerror\fR | \fIwarning\fR | \fIinfo\fR | \fIdebug\fR
Sets the level of debugging. If set to \fInone\fR, nothing will be logged. If
set to \fIdebug\fR, you will get a bunch of messages. Default value is
\fIinfo\fR.
.TP
\fBInclude\fR \fIfile\fR
Includes the contents of \fIfile\fR at this point, so you can specify some
parameters in that included \fIfile\fR. File name is relative
to ASPseek etc directory (\fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@\fR).
.SS Parameters that affects memory usage vs. performance
These parameters can be tuned to achieve the better performance on boxes
with enough memory. They can also be used to reduce the amount of memory
used by \fBindex\fR(1).
.TP
\fBDeltaBufferSize\fR \fIkilobytes\fR
Size of buffer for each of 100 delta files, in kilobytes. Setting of low value
for this parameter can result in big fragmentation of delta files.
Value of this parameter affects used memory. If default value is used,
then 50 Mb of memory is used for buffers. Default value is \fI512\fR.
.TP
\fBUrlBufferSize\fR \fIkilobytes\fR
Size of read and write buffer allocated during inverted index merging for
\fBind\fR files, in kilobytes. Value of this parameter affects used memory
during inverted index merging. Default value is \fBDeltaBufferSize\fR * 8.
.TP
\fBWordCacheSize\fR \fInumber\fR
Maximum word count in the word cache. Word cache is used to reduce database
load for converting word to its word ID. Default value is \fI50000\fR.
.TP
\fBHrefCacheSize\fR \fInumber\fR
Maximum URL count in the href cache. Href cache is used to reduce database
load for converting URL of outgoing hyperlink to its URL ID.
Default value is \fI10000\fR.
.TP
\fBNextDocLimit\fR \fInumber\fR
Maximum number of URLs loaded from database at each request.
Default value is \fI1000\fR.

This option is used only if URLs to be indexed are ordered by next index time;
otherwise, if \fB-o\fR option to \fBindex\fR(1) is used, all URLs for current
hop is taken at once.
.SS Database format parameters
These parameters set different modes of storing indexed information.
Note that database format is different if you change these options,
so the same value \fBmust\fR be set in \fBsearchd.conf\fR(5) file, and you
\fBmust not\fR change the values on a non-empty database.
.TP
\fBHiByteFirst\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets the byte ordering used in field \fBwordurl[1].word\fR
(only in Unicode version). Default is \fIno\fR.
.TP
\fBIncrementalCitations\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to build citation index, ranks of pages and lastmod
incrementally. If value of this parameter is set to \fIyes\fR, then
calculating of citations, ranks of pages and lastmod file will require
less memory and take less time on large databases. So it is very handy
if you want to index large number of URLs and have relatively small amount
of memory. Default is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBCompactStorage\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets the storage mode of reverse index. In compact storage mode, file/BLOB
is not created for each word. Instead, information about all words is stored
in 300 files. In this mode, updating of reverse index is generally much
faster and requires a bit less memory than in the old mode.
Default is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBUtfStorage\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
This parameter has sense only in Unicode version and only for MySQL back-end.
In UTF8 storage mode fields \fBwordurl[1].word\fR are stored in UTF8 encoding.
This mode can reduce sizes of data and index files for \fBwordurl\fR table.
To convert existing Unicode database to this mode, run \fBindex -b\fR.
Default value is \fIno\fR.
.SS Bandwidth control
.TP
\fBMaxBandwidth\fR \fIbytes\fR [\fIstarttime\fR [\fIendtime\fR]]
Sets maximum used bandwidth for incoming traffic to \fIbytes\fR per second
for the specified period of time of day. Arguments \fIstarttime\fR and
\fIendtime\fR are in seconds from midnight (0:00). If \fIendtime\fR is
omitted, then it is implied to be the end of the day (86400). If both
\fIstarttime\fR and \fIendtime\fR are omitted, then the limit is for
the whole day. You can use several \fBMaxBandwidth\fR commands.
Note that if \fIendtime\fR is less than \fIstarttime\fR, \fBindex\fR(1)
will handle it correctly, setting two intervals from \fIstarttime\fR to
midnight and from midnight to \fIendtime\fR. By default bandwidth is not
limited.
.SS Indexing
.TP
\fBServer\fR \fIURL\fR
Add \fIURL\fR as an URL to start indexing from. You can specify many
\fBServer\fR commands, and set the different options for different sites -
see below. Note that if \fIURL\fR contains path, the whole site will be
indexed nevertheless, so to limit indexing to some subdirectory of site
use \fBDisallow\fR parameter described below.
.SS Global indexing parameters
Each of the below parameters can be specified only once in configuration file
and takes the global effect for the whole \fBindex\fR(1) session.
.TP
\fBMaxDocSize\fR \fIbytes\fR
Sets the maximum document size in bytes, so if document size is bigger than
\fIbytes\fR, only the first \fIbytes\fR of the document will be processed.
Default value is \fI1048576\fR bytes (1Mb).
.TP
\fBHTTPHeader\fR \fIheader\fR
Add \fIheader\fR to headers that \fBindex\fR(1) sends in HTTP request. You
should not use \fIIf-Modified-Since\fR or \fIAccept-Charset\fR headers here,
as \fBindex\fR(1) sends it anyway. Header \fIUser-Agent: aspseek/@VERSION@\fR
is sent too, but you may override it.
.TP
\fBClones\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to enable clones eliminating. Clone is a document which is
absolutely the same as another document. If this set to \fIyes\fR, clone
is not parsed/stored in the database, instead word information for original
document is used. Default value is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBMinWordLength\fR \fInumber\fR
Sets the minimum length of word to be stored in the database, so words
shorter than \fInumber\fR is not stored. Default value is \fI1\fR.
.TP
\fBMaxWordLength\fR \fInumber\fR
Sets the maximum length of word to be stored in the database, so words
longer than \fInumber\fR is not stored. Default value is \fI32\fR. Note
that you can't set the value higher than 32.
.TP
\fBDeleteNoServer\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to delete URLs which have no correspondent "Server" commands.
Default value is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBAddressExpiry\fR \fItime\fR
Sets expiration time for "DNS name -> IP" entry in address cache.
After entry is expired, resolver will make DNS lookup again.
Argument \fItime\fR can be set in seconds, or the same way as in
\fBPeriod\fR command below. Default value is 1 hour.
.SS Indexing scope
These parameters can is used to limit the scope of indexing.
\fBindex\fR(1) will compare all URLs against all \fBCheckOnly\fR,
\fBCheckOnlyNoMatch\fR, \fBAllow\fR, \fBAllowNoMatch\fR, \fBDisallow\fR
and \fBDisallowNoMatch\fR directives in the order specified in configuration
file, so order is important. Note that by default everything is allowed.
.PP
Some directives below use POSIX regular expressions (regexp) for flexibility.
For description of what regexp is, see \fBregex\fR(7), \fBgrep\fR(1),
\fBawk\fR(1).
.TP
\fBFollowOutside\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether \fBindex\fR(1) should index outside sites defined in \fBServer\fR
directives. Default is \fIno\fR. If you set it to \fIyes\fR, be sure to limit
the scope of indexing in some other way (for example, with \fBMaxHops\fR).
.TP
\fBCheckOnly\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
Use \fBHEAD\fR request instead of \fBGET\fR for URLs matching \fIregexp\fR.
So, such URLs will not be downloaded, just information
about them will be stored in \fBurlword\fR table.
.TP
\fBCheckOnlyNoMatch\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
Use \fBHEAD\fR request instead of \fBGET\fR for URLs \fBnot\fR matching
\fIregexp\fR. So, such URLs will not be downloaded, just information
about them will be stored in \fBurlword\fR table.
.TP
\fBAllow\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
Allows to index URLs matching \fIregexp\fR.
.TP
\fBAllowNoMatch\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
Allows to index URLs \fBnot\fR matching \fIregexp\fR.
.TP
\fBDisallow\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
.TP
\fBDisallowNoMatch\fR \fIregexp\fR [\fIregexp\fR...]
Disallows to index URLs \fBnot\fR matching \fIregexp\fR.
.TP
\fBCountries\fR \fIfile\fR
Loads countries IP information from \fIfile\fR. File consists of lines in the
form "sss.sss.sss.sss - eee.eee.eee.eee cc", where \fIsss.sss.sss.sss\fR
is starting IP address, \fIeee.eee.eee.eee\fR is ending IP address,
and \fIcc\fR is a country code (like \fIru\fR, \fIde\fR, etc.).
Note that value of ending address should be more than starting
address.
.TP
\fBAllowCountries\fR \fIcc1\fR [\fIcc2\fR...]
Specifies to index only sites from countries specified by \fIcc1\fR,
\fIcc2\fR, etc. Should be used together with the \fBCountries\fR.
.SS Indexing parameters - local
Each of the below parameters can be specified many times in configuration
file, applies to all \fBServer\fR parameters below it, and valid till next
parameter with the same name, or till the end of configuration file.
.TP
\fBPeriod\fR \fItime\fR
Sets the re-index period to \fItime\fR. Value can be set just in seconds, or
using a special characters right after the number (no spaces allowed):
\fBs\fR for seconds, \fBM\fR for minutes, \fBh\fR for hours, \fBd\fR for days,
\fRm\fR for months and \fBy\fR for years. You can combine several values
together, for example string \fI1m12d\fR means "one month and twelve days".
You can also specify negative numbers, say \fI1m-10d\fR stands for "one month
minus ten days". Default value is \fI7d\fR.
.TP
\fBTag\fR \fInumber\fR
Use this field to "tag" several \fBServer\fRs with value \fInumber\fR,
which can later be used with option \fB-t\fR \fInumber\fR of \fBindex\fR(1)
command. Note that if you want to group several sites together for searching
purposes, you should use "spaces" or "subsets" features of ASPseek, not tag.
.TP
\fBMaxHops\fR \fBnumber\fR
Sets the maximum hops ("mouse clicks") from URL specified by \fBServer\fR
command, so documents that are "deeper" will not be indexed.
Default value is \fI256\fR.
.TP
\fBIncrementHopsOnRedirect\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether \fBindex\fR(1) should increment hops value when HTTP redirect
is encountered. Applies only to redirects generated by "\fBLocation:\fR" HTTP
headers. Setting this option to \fIno\fR allows a greater number of documents
to be indexed for sites that redirect frequently (e.g. for cookie testing,
typically on each page). Default value is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBRedirectLoopLimit\fR \fInumber\fR
Allow no more than \fInumber\fR of contiguous redirects. This option is
especially useful if you set \fBIncrementHopsOnRedirect\fR to \fIno\fR,
because \fBindex\fR(1) can fall in an endless redirect loop. Limiting the
number of redirects prevents \fBindex\fR from such redirect loops.
Default value is \fI8\fR.
.TP
\fBMaxDocsPerServer\fR \fInumber\fR
Sets that no more than \fInumber\fR of documents will be indexed from one
site during one run of \fBindex\fR(1). Default value is \fI-1\fR, which
means no limits.
.TP
\fBMaxDocsAtOnce\fR \fInumber\fR
Sets the maximum number of pages to be downloaded from the same host before
switching to the next host. Large values are believed to increase indexing
performance when number of indexed sites is large. Default value is \fI1\fR.
.TP
\fBReadTimeOut\fR \fItime\fR
Sets the maximum timeout to \fItime\fR for downloading a document from site.
Argument can be expressed in seconds, or in the same form as in \fBPeriod\fR
command above. Default value is 90 seconds.
.TP
\fBRobots\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether the robot exclusion standard (\fB\f(CWrobots.txt\fR file and
META NAME="robots") will be honored. Default is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBDeleteBad\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to delete bad (not found, forbidden etc.) URLs from the database.
Default value is \fIno\fR.
.TP
\fBIndex\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to store words into database. Default value is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBFollow\fR \fIyes\fR | \fIno\fR
Sets whether to store links found into database. Default value is \fIyes\fR.
.TP
\fBCharset\fR \fIcharset\fR
Usable to set charset for the servers that do not return it. Argument should
be known charset name (see below for charset configuration). Alternatively,
you can use charset guesser feature of \fBindex\fR(1).
.TP
\fBReplace\fR [\fIregexp\fR [\fIreplacement\fR]]
This parameter allows to replace URL matching \fIregexp\fR by
\fIreplacement\fR, or by empty string if \fIreplacement\fR is
not specified. This is useful for sites with dynamic contents
where the same information can be obtained by many different
URLs. \fBReplace\fR without arguments disables any
replacements for subsequent \fBServer\fR commands.

As in \fBsed\fR(1) command \fBs\fR, the \fIreplacement\fR can contain
\fI\\N\fR (\fIN\fR being a number from 1 to 9, inclusive) references,
which refer to the portion of the match which is contained between
\fIN\fRth '\\(' and its matching '\\)'.
To include a literal '\\', precede it with another '\\'.
.TP
\fBMinDelay\fR \fItime\fR
Sets minimum time between finishing of access to server and beginning
of next access to the server. This is useful if site owner blames you
for "bombing" his site with your \fBindex\fR(1) queries.
Argument \fItime\fR can be set in seconds, or in the same way as
described in \fBPeriod\fR command above. Default value is \fI0\fR.
.TP
\fBProxy\fR [\fIhost.com\fR[:\fIport\fR]]
Use proxy rather than direct connection. You can also index FTP sites
via proxy. If \fIport\fR is not specified, default is \fI3128\fR
(sqiud). \fBProxy\fR without arguments disables proxy.
.SS External converters
\fBindex\fR(1) has an ability to deal with document types other than
\fBtext/plain\fR and \fBtext/html\fR. It does so with the help of an external
programs or scripts, which can convert from some format to \fBtext/plain\fR
(or \fBtext/html\fR), so you are able to index \fB\f(CW.ps\fR, \fB\f(CW.pdf\fR
etc.
.TP
\fBConverter\fR \fIfrom/type\fR \fIto/type\fR[; \fBcharset\fR=\fIcset\fR] \fIcommand line\fR
Specifies that for converting documents with MIME-type \fIfrom/type\fR to
MIME-type \fIto/type\fR the command specified by \fIcommand line\fR will
be used. Argument \fIfrom/type\fR can be any type returned by Web server.
Argument \fIto/type\fR can be either \fItext/plain\fR or \fItext/html\fR.
If you add \fB;charset\fR=\fIcset\fR string after \fIto/type\fR, \fBindex\fR
will know that resulting document has a charset \fIcset\fR, otherwise it
is assumed to be \fBus-ascii\fR.


In the \fIcommand line\fR you usually specify program or script to run,
together with its options. Program is expected to to read from stdin and
write the converted document to stdout.

If your program can't deal with stdin/stdout streams, you should use
\fB$in\fR and \fB$out\fR strings in \fBcommand line\fR, and they will be
substituted with two file names in \f(CW/tmp\fR directory. \fBindex\fR(1)
will create files with unique names, write the document downloaded to the
first file (referenced as \fB$in\fR), run the \fI/bin/prog\fR, read the second
file (referenced as \fB$out\fR) into memory, and then delete both files.

You can also use \fB$url\fR in \fIcommand line\fR, it will be substituted with
the actual URL of downloaded document. You can use it in your own scripts to
distinguish between a different document variations, or to be able to write
one script for many different MIME-types.

Please note that \fBindex\fR(1) relies on a \fBContent-Type\fR header
returned by a Web server. Some Web-servers are misconfigured and give wrong
info (for example, return header
\fBContent-Type: audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin\fR for \fB\f(CW.rpm\fR
files).

Examples:

.nf
\f(CWConverter app/ps text/plain; charset=iso8859-1 ps2ascii
# ps2ascii can't deal with PDF files from stdin
Converter application/pdf text/plain ps2ascii $in $out
.fi
\fR
.SS Charset configuration for non-Unicode version
Charset configuration for non-Unicode version is usually stored in
file \fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/charsets.conf\fR.
Charset files for non-Unicode version can be found in
\fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/charsets\fR directory. Langmap files can be
found in \fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/langmap\fR directory.
.TP
\fBCharsetTable\fR \fIcharset\fR \fIlang\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIlmfile\fR]
Loads the table for \fIcharset\fR of language \fIlang\fR from \fIfile\fR.
Optionally load langmap file \fIlmfile\fR, which is used for charset guesser.
.TP
\fBCharsetAlias\fR \fIcharset\fR \fIalias1\fR [\fIalias2\fR...]
Defines \fIalias1\fR, \fIalias2\fR, ... as aliases (alternative names)
for \fIcharset\fR. This is needed because in many cases there is no
"one true name" for the charset - different web servers and page
authors use different names.
.TP
\fBLocalCharset\fR \fIcharset\fR
Sets the local charset for ASPseek, so all data in the database is assumed
to be in that charset.
.SS Charset configuration for Unicode version
Charset configuration for Unicode version is usually stored in
file \fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/ucharset.conf\fR. Charset files for Unicode version
can be found in \fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/tables\fR directory.
.TP
\fBCharsetTableU1\fR \fIcharset\fR \fIlang\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIlmfile\fR]
Loads the Unicode mapping for \fIcharset\fR of language \fIlang\fR from
\fIfile\fR. Optionally load langmap file \fIlmfile\fR, which is used for
charset guesser.
.TP
\fBCharsetTableU2\fR \fIcharset\fR \fIlang\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIlmfile\fR]
Loads the Unicode mapping for multibyte \fIcharset\fR of language
\fIlang\fR from \fIfile\fR. Optionally load langmap file \fIlmfile\fR,
which is used for charset guesser.
.TP
\fBDictionary2\fR \fIlang\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIcharset\fR]
Loads dictionary for \fIlang\fR from \fIfile\fR. If \fIcharset\fR is not
specified, it is assumed that the file is in Unicode. Dictionary is used
for tokenizing of text in Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.
.SS Stopwords
Stopwords configuration is usually stored in the file
\fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/stopwords.conf\fR. Stopword files for different languages
can be found in \fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/stopwords\fR directory.
.TP
\fBStopwordFile \fIlang\fR \fIfile\fR [\fIcharset\fR]
Loads stopwords for language \fIlang\fR from \fIfile\fR. If \fIcharset\fR
is not specified, file contents is assumed to be in \fBLocalCharset\fR,
otherwize it is in \fIcharset\fR.
