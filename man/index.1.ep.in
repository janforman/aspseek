.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBindex\fR is a component of \fBASPseek\fR that performs Web crawling,
documents downloading, parsing and storing. It can also be used to
manipulate the \fBASPseek\fR database.
.PP
During indexing process, \fBindex\fR walks across the sites and stores
found pages in a special data structures called delta files, and in SQL
database.
.PP
When there is no more pages to index (or upon executing \fBindex -D\fR),
it sorts delta files and merges information from delta files
into searchable database).
.PP
\fBindex\fR supports HTTP and HTTP over SSL (https) protocols, and can parse
documents in HTML and plain text formats. Support for other formats can be
achieved via external converter programs.
.PP
The operation of \fBindex\fR is mostly controlled by its configuration
file \fBaspseek.conf\fR(5), which is read upon startup. You can give
configuration file name as a last argument to \fBindex\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Indexing options
.IP \fB-n\fR\ \fInumber\fR
Index only \fInumber\fR of documents and exit. Note that you should run
\fBindex -D\fR manually after running \fBindex -n\fR. Actual number of
documents indexed can be a little higher than value requested if you use
many threads.
.IP \fB-N\fR\ \fInumber\fR
Run \fInumber\fR of \fBindex\fR threads. It makes sense if you have many
different sites to index, since no two threads are allowed to index the
same site.
.IP \fB-R\fR\ \fInumber\fR
Run \fInumber\fR of resolver processes. Default is
(argument of \fB-N\fR option)/5 + 1.
It makes sense to increase the default value if your name server is slow.
.IP \fB-i\fR
Insert new URLs to database. URLs to insert can be given using
\fB-u\fR or \fB-f\fR options.
.SS Re-indexing control
.IP \fB-a\fR
Re-index all documents regardless of their expiration status. Normally (without
this option) only documents that have indexed earlier than \fBPeriod\fR time
ago are re-indexed.
.IP \fB-m\fR
Store words and hrefs found in documents regardless of their modification
status. Normally (without this option) only those documents that have
changed since last re-indexing are parsed.
.IP \fB-o\fR
Index documents with less hops first. Here "hops" means the "depth" value
of the document.
.IP \fB-q\fR
Don't add URLs from \fBServer\fR configuration command (and their
corresponding \fBrobots.txt\fR URLs) to database. This can be used if you
haven't changed your \fBaspseek.conf\fR(5) after last \fBindex\fR run and
is believed to speed up \fBindex\fR startup in case you have several
thousands \fBServer\fR entries in config.
.IP \fB-M\fR
Index URLs which were indexed by previous indexing session. These URLs are
stored in \fBtmpurl\fR SQL table. Used mostly for debugging purposes.
.SS Indexing to real-time database
.IP \fB-T\fR\ \fIURL\fR
Index \fIURL\fR to real-time database, so it will be available for
searching in seconds. Note that you can't add too many documents to real-time
database, otherwise the subsequent indexing to real-time database will be
extremely slow. Actual limit of documents in real-time database is
hardware dependent; well, about 1000 URLs should work OK. Documents from
real-time database are merged to main database upon executing \fBindex -D\fR.

This option is used to frequently re-index ever-changing
pages (like first pages of news sites), or to re-index URL out-of-the-order
(when you know it has just been changed) and see results immediately. Note that
you can use \fB-A\fR option together with this one.
.SS Clearing the database
.IP \fB-C\fR
Clear the database. You can use subsection control options (described below)
to limit clearing to some part of the database. Note that clearing with limits
may be quite slow on large database.
.IP \fB-w\fR
Used together with \fB-C\fR to disallow asking for confirmation before
clearing.
.SS Statistics
.IP \fB-S\fR
Print simple database statistics. You can use subsection control options
(described below) together with this option.
.SS Subsection control
In most cases you can combine any of \fB-u\fR, \fB-s\fR and \fB-t\fR options.
.IP \fB-s\fR\ \fIstatus\fR
Limit index to documents matching \fIstatus\fR (HTTP Status code, or 0 for documents
that were not yet indexed.
.IP \fB-t\fR\ \fItag\fR
Limit index to documents matching \fItag\fR. Tags can be set in
\fBaspseek.conf\fR(5) file.
.IP \fB-u\fR\ \fIpattern\fR
Limit index to documents with URLs matching \fIpattern\fR (supports SQL LIKE
wildcard characters '\fB%\fR' and '\fB_\fR').
.IP \fB-f\fR\ \fIfile\fR
Read URLs to be indexed/inserted/cleared from \fIfile\fR.
You can use \fI-\fR as file name, in that case
URL list will be read from \fBstdin\fR.
.SS Output
.IP \fB-r\fR\ \fIfile\fR
Redirect output to \fIfile\fR.
.IP \fB-g\fR\ \fIfile\fR
Sets indexing statistics log file name to \fIfile\fR. Default is
\fB\f(CW@localstatedir@/\fIDBName\fR\fB\f(CW/logs.txt\fR.
.SS Stopping index
.IP \fB-E\fR
Safely stop already running \fBindex\fR process. Usable from scripts.
.SS Database repairing
.IP \fB-X1\fR
Check the inverted index for URLs for which \fBdeleted\fR field in
\fBurlword\fR SQL table is non-zero, or \fBstatus\fR field is not 200,
or \fBorigin\fR field is not 1.
.IP \fB-X2\fR
Fix the above case by appending information about deleted keys to delta files.
So, if you want to remove such records,
run \fBindex -X2\fR, \fBindex -D\fR and finally perform SQL statements
to delete unnecessary records.
.IP \fB-H\fR
Recreate citation indexes and ranks file from \fBurlwords\fINN\fB.hrefs\fR
fields in case of citation index corruption.
.SS Database operations
.IP \fB-D\fR
Merge delta files into main database. This implies \fB-B\fR, \fB-K\fR
and \fB-U\fR.
.IP \fB-B\fR
Generate subsets and spaces.
.IP \fB-K\fR
Calculate PageRanks.
.IP \fB-U\fR
Calculate total number of non-empty URL, which is saved to
\fB\f(CW@localstatedir@/\fIDBName\fR\fB\f(CW/total\fR file).
.SS Miscellaneous
.IP \fB-P\fR\ \fIURL\fR
Prints path to specified \fIURL\fR. Here path means the way by which index
found that URL by outgoing links.
.IP \fB-A\fR\ \fIspace_id\fR
Add/delete a site to/from web space (use together with \fB-u\fR or \fB-A\fR
options).
.SS Getting help
.IP \fB-h\fR,\ \fB-?\fR
Print short help page.
