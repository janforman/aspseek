.SH NAME
s.cgi \- aspseek search CGI front-end
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhttp://your.host.com/cgi-bin/s.cgi\fR[?\fBparameter=\fIvalue\fR[&\fBparameter\fR=\fIvalue\fR...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs.cgi\fR is a search front-end of aspseek. It is a CGI program, so
usually it is run by web server. \fBs.cgi\fR parses its options,
reads its configuration and template from \fBs.htm\fR(5) file residing
in @sysconfdir@ directory, makes a query to \fBsearchd\fR(1),
formats the results according to template, and outputs HTML page
containing results found, or error, or empty search form in case
no query was specified.
.PP
Functionality of \fBs.cgi\fR related to template and meta symbols
is described in \fBs.htm\fR(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fBq\fR=\fIquery\fR" 10
Query string. Input line in search form, used for query entering,
should be named "\fBq\fR".
.IP "\fBul\fR=\fIsql_pattern\fR [\fIsql_pattern\fR ...]" 10
.IP "\fBul\fR=\fIsite\fR [\fIsite\fR ...]" 10
URL mask. Several masks can be used, delimited by exactly 1 space.
This parameter can also be used multiple times, values are concatenated.
\fIsql_pattern\fR specifies subdirectory of site, and record in \fBsubsets\fR
table containing value of \fIsql_pattern\fR in the field \fBmask\fR must exist.
\fIsite\fR specifies the whole site, it should be in the form
\fIhttp://www.sitename.com/\fR. Note that \fIsql_pattern\fRs and \fIsite\fRs
can not be mixed together. Examples:
.nf
\fBul\fR=\fIhttp://www.aspstreet.com/\fR
\fBul\fR=\fIhttp://www.aspstreet.com/directory/%\fR
.fi
.IP "\fBr\fR=\fIquery\fR" 10
Previous query string. Used for searching in results, when \fBin\fR
parameters is equal to \fIon\fR.
.IP "\fBs\fR=\fIrate\fR | \fIdate\fR" 10
Result sorting type. \fIrate\fR means sorting by rate (relevance),
and \fIdate\fR means sorting by last modification date. Sorting order is
descending, so results with greater rate or latter modification date will
be first ones.
.IP "\fBin\fR=\fIon\fR" 10
Used for "search within results" feature. If value of this parameter is
\fIon\fR, then actual query is composed from parameters \fBq\fR and \fBr\fR
combined by AND. Any other value is ignored.
Checkbox "Search within results" in query form, that is displayed in search
results, should be named \fBin\fR. Also, the following string should be put
in query form:
.nf
\f(CW<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="r" VALUE="$q">\fR
.fi
.IP \fBt\fR=\fIquery\fR 10
Used for "Take me there" feature. If this parameter is present, then
\fBs.cgi\fR finds first results matching query and generates output
for redirection to that URL.
.IP "\fBch\fR=\fIurl\fR" 10
"Cached" URL. This parameter is used for displaying "cached" copy of web page.
Can be combined with \fBq\fR, \fBcs\fR and \fBtmpl\fR parameters.
If \fBq\fR and \fBcs\fR parameters are present, then appropriate query terms
will appear highlighted in "cached" page.
.IP \fBnp\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Result page number. Default value is \fI0\fR.
.IP \fBps\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Number of results per page. Overrides value set by "preferences" cookie.
.IP \fBgr\fR=\fIoff\fR 10
Grouping results by site. If value of this parameter is \fIoff\fR, then
results are not grouped by site. Any other value is ignored.
.IP \fBst\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Site ID. Value of this parameter is used to restrict search by specified site.
Generated in search results, as result of $SH meta symbol, which is used in
\fBmoreurls\fR template.
.IP \fBtmpl\fR=\fIfile\fR 10
Template file name. \fIfile\fR is relative to \f(CW@sysconfdir@\fR
directory.
Default is constructed from the part of \fBs.cgi\fR name before point
with \fI.htm\fR added, so \fBs.cgi\fR will look for \fBs.htm\fR, and
if you rename it to \fBanother.cgi\fR, it will look for \fBanother.htm\fR.
.IP \fBsp\fR\fIN\fR=\fIon\fR 10
Space ID. \fIN\fR is one or more digits value. If value of this parameter
is \fIon\fR, then search is restricted by web space with ID equal to \fIN\fR.
Any other value is ignored. This parameter can be used multiple times,
all spaces are being ORed.
.br
To assign particular site to web space, insert record with appropriate
values or site ID and space ID into table \fBspaces\fR.
.IP "\fBcs\fR=\fIcharset\fR" 10
Source charset. Tells \fBs.cgi\fR which \fIcharset\fR is used in input query.
This is required parameter if non-ascii characters are used in query.
Results of query will also be presented in that \fIcharset\fR.
.IP "\fBfm\fR=\fIon\fR | \fIoff\fR | \fIlang\fR[,\fIlang\fR,..]" 10
Word forms. Can be comma-separated list of languages or just \fIon\fR
or \fIoff\fR. In case it is not set to \fIoff\fR, \fBs.cgi\fR will search
for all forms of specified words, and results with exact word forms
will be displayed first.
.br
Example: if word 'create' is specified, then documents containing
either 'create' or 'creates' or 'created' will be found.
.IP \fBad\fR=\fIon\fR 10
Account distance. If value is \fIon\fR, then \fBs.cgi\fR ranks documents
with search terms closer to the beginning higher. Any other value is ignored.
Overrides \fBAccountDistance\fR parameter in \fBsearchd.conf\fR(5).
.IP \fBln\fR=\fIurl\fR 10
Link to page. Tells to \fBs.cgi\fR to find pages which have link to the
specified \fIurl\fR. If protocol in \fIurl\fR is omitted, then http://
is implied. If \fIurl\fR is not found and last symbol is not '/',
than \fBs.cgi\fR tries to find URL with '/' at the end.
.SS Limiting search scope to certain parts of HTML pages
Parameters \fBbd\fR, \fBds\fR, \fBkw\fR and \fBtl\fR can be used together.
.IP \fBbd\fR=\fIon\fR 10
Search in body. If value of this parameter is \fBon\fR, then advanced
search will be performed only within HTML <BODY>...</BODY>. Any other value
is ignored.
.IP \fBds\fR=\fIon\fR 10
Search in description. If value of this parameter is \fBon\fR, then advanced
search will be performed only within HTML <META NAME="DESCRIPTION"...>.
Any other value is ignored.
.IP "\fBkw\fR=\fIon\fR" 10
Search in keywords. If value of this parameter is \fBon\fR, then advanced
search will be performed only within HTML <META NAME="KEYWORDS"...>.
Any other value is ignored.
.IP "\fBtl\fR=\fIon\fR" 10
Search in title. If value of this parameter is \fBon\fR, then advanced
search will be performed only within HTML <TITLE>...</TITLE>. Any other value
is ignored.
.SS Limiting search scope to certain period of dates
.IP "\fBdt\fR=\fIback\fR | \fIer\fR | \fIrange\fR" 10
Type of time limit. See below.
.IP "\fBdp\fR=\fIdate\fR" 10
If 'dt' is 'back', that means you want to limit result to recent pages, so you
specify that "recentness" in \fIdate\fR value, that is specified in the form
\fIxxxA\fR[\fIyyyB\fR...], there \fIxxx\fR, \fIyyy\fR are numbers (which can
also be negative), and \fIA\fR, \fIB\fR can be one of the following (the
letters below are the same as in \fBstrptime\fR(3) and \fBstrftime\fR(3)
functions):

.TS
box;
cB | cB
rfI | l.
Character	Meaning
_
s	second
M	minute
h	hour
d	day
m	month
y	year
.TE

Examples of values for \fBdp\fR parameter:

.TS
allbox;
cB cB cB
lfI l n.
String	Meaning	Value, s
4h30m	2 hours and 30 minutes	16200
1Y6m-15d	T{
1 year and six month minus 15 days
T}	45792000
1h-60M+1s	T{
1 hour minus 60 minutes plus 1 second
T}	1
.TE

Note that \fBASPseek\fR do not use minutes and seconds of document's
last modification date, so specifying something more precise than
hour is useless (but still allowed).
.IP "\fBdx\fR=\fI1\fR | \fI-1\fR" 10
If \fBdt\fR is \fIer\fR (which is short for newer/older), that means the search
will be limited to pages newer or older than date given. Parameter \fBdx\fR is
newer/older flag, value \fI1\fR means "newer" or "after", and value \fI-1\fR
means "older" or "before". The actual date is separated into
\fBdd\fR, \fBdm\fR, \fBdy\fR fields as follows.
.IP \fBdd\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Day of month (1...31)
.IP "\fBdm\fR=\fInumber\fR" 10
Month (0 - January, 1 - February, .., 11 - December)
.IP \fBdy\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Year (four digits, for example 2001)
.IP \fBdb\fR=\fIdd/mm/yyyy\fR 10
.IP \fBde\fR=\fIdd/mm/yyyy\fR 10
If \fBdt\fR is \fIrange\fR, that means search within given range of dates.
Parameters \fBdb\fR and \fBde\fR are used in this case and stands for
beginning and ending date, respectively. Each date is in the form
\fIdd/mm/yyyy\fR, there \fIdd\fR is day of month number (1...31), \fImm\fR is
month number (1...12), and \fIyyyy\fR is four-digits year.
.IP \fBfr\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.IP \fBto\fR=\fIvalue\fR
These parameters are passed to \fBs.cgi\fR in subsequent search pages;
they contains date and time in internal format used by \fBs.cgi\fR.
.SS Advanced search
.IP \fBiq\fR=\fIwords\fR 10
Include \fIwords\fR. Used in advanced search. If this parameter is not empty,
then parameter \fBq\fR is not used.
.IP \fBxq\fR=\fIwords\fR 10
Exclude \fIwords\fR. Used in advanced search. All words found in value
of this parameter will be added to query with \fB-\fR sign before them.
.IP \fBim\fR=\fIp\fR 10
Include mode. If value of this parameter is equal to \fIp\fR, then value
of parameter \fBiq\fR is double-quoted, which means pages containing
phrase must be found.
.IP \fBxm\fR=\fIp\fR 10
Exclude mode. If value of this parameter is equal to \fIp\fR, then value
of parameter \fBxq\fR is double-quoted, which means pages containing
phrase must be excluded.
.IP "\fBis\fR=\fIsite_pattern\fR [\fIsite_pattern\fR ...]" 10
Include sites. This parameter is used to restrict search by sites
those names contains \fIsite_pattern\fR. If several patterns delimited
by space are used, then they are ORed. Examples: \fBis\fR=\fIwww.google\fR,
\fBis\fR=\fI.com\fR.
.IP "\fBxs\fR=\fIsite_pattern\fR [\fIsite_pattern\fR ...]" 10
Exclude sites. This parameter is used to to exclude sites those names
contains \fIsite_pattern\fR from results. If several patterns delimited
by space are used, then they are ORed.
.IP \fBo\fR=\fInumber\fR 10
Use "\fInumber\fR+1"th template sections if possible. See "Defining
different output formats" subsection in \fBs.htm\fR(5).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP \fBQUERY_STRING\fR 10
This variable is usually set by web server and contains all the parameters
for \fBs.cgi\fR described in OPTIONS above.
.IP \fBASPSEEK_TEMPLATE\fR 10
.IP \fBUDMSEARCH_TEMPLATE\fR 10
Template file to use. Overridden by \fBtmpl\fR parameter. If both variables are
used, \fBASPSEEK_TEMPLATE\fR is preferable.
.IP \fBHTTP_COOKIE\fR 10
Cookies can be sent by client browser together with request. Web server forms
\fBHTTP_COOKIE\fR environment variable from it. \fBs.cgi\fR parses it and
uses value of \fBPS\fR section as the number of results per page. This is
overridden by \fBps\fR parameter.
.IP \fBHTTP_HOST\fR 10
Value is set by web server and is used together with self name to form
HREF references to other result pages.
.IP \fBSCRIPT_NAME\fR 10
Value is set by web server and is used to determine the self name of the script
and the name of template file to load (see description of \fBtmpl\fR parameter).
.IP "\fBREDIRECT_STATUS\fR" 10
.IP "\fBREDIRECT_URL\fR" 10
.IP "\fBPATH_TRANSLATED\fR" 10
These variables can possibly be set by web server (for example, by Apache
using its "AddHandler" and "Action" directives).
If \fBREDIRECT_STATUS\fR is set, \fBs.cgi\fR will get the self name from
\fBREDIRECT_URL\fR, and template file name from \fBPATH_TRANSLATED\fR.
.SH FILES
\fB\f(CW@sysconfdir@/s.htm\fR
.SH BUGS
It appears that \fBtmpl\fR parameter is broken since version 1.2.8. Use
either \fBASPSEEK_TEMPLATE\fR environment variable, or rename \fBs.cgi\fR.
.SH NOTES
When parameters are passed in URL, they should be encoded according to
RFC 1738. If values are coming from form input fields, they are encoded
by browser (so, for example, space character becomes either '+' or '%20').
\fBs.cgi\fR does all appropriate decoding of parameter values and
encoding of links to the other pages it generates whenever needed.
In this page values are shown in non-encoded form.
