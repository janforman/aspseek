.SH NAME
s.htm \- template and configuration for s.cgi
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f(CW@sysconfdir@/s.htm\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs.htm\fR acts both as a configuration file and as a HTML template for
\fBs.cgi\fR(1). It looks like HTML file, and is divided into sections.
\fBs.cgi\fR(1) takes some sections, makes meta variables substitution
in them, and outputs the resulting HTML.
.PP
Section is a piece of \fBs.htm\fR file that is started with line
\f(CW<!--sectionname-->\fR and ends with line \f(CW<!--/sectionname-->\fR.
Section consists of HTML formatted text containing meta variables.
Meta variable is one or two letters preceded by $ sign (example: $DX).
Meta variable names are case-sensitive.
\fBs.cgi\fR(1) substitutes meta variables with corresponding string.
.SS Special ``variables'' section
This is a special section in which you define various configuration
parameters in the form "\fBParameter\fR \fIvalue\fR".
Unlike all the other sections, it starts with the string
\f(CW<!--variables\fR and ends with \f(CW-->\fR. The contents of this
section is never included in \fBs.cgi\fR(1) output.
.PP
The following parameters are defined here.
.IP "\fBDaemonAddress\fR \fIxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\fR[:\fInnn\fR]"
Defines the IP address (\fIxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\fR) and port
(\fInnn\fR) of search daemon \fBsearchd\fR(1). If port is
not set, ASPseek's default port is used.

You \fIshould\fR put at least one \fBDaemonAddress\fR. You \fIcan\fR
put several \fBDaemonAddress\fR lines; in this case \fBs.cgi\fR(1)
will connect to all \fBsearchd\fR(1) daemons, retrieve results from
all of it, and show merged results.

Note that you can't give DNS names (like \fBwww.myhost.com\fR) as an
argument to \fBDaemonAddress\fR, only numeric IP addresses are allowed
here. This is done because name lookup needed in case of DNS name
will slow down \fBs.cgi\fR(1) considerably.
.IP "\fBMaxExcerpts\fR \fInum\fR"
Defines the maximum number of excerpts that are shown in results.
.IP "\fBMaxExcerptLen\fR \fInum\fR"
Defines the maximum length (in characters) of each excerpt string.
.IP "\fBPagesPerScreen \fInum\fR"
Defines the maximum number of links to other search result pages
to be shown if there are many results found.
.IP "\fBResultsPerPage\fR \fInum\fR"
Defines how many results will be shown on one page.
Note that this value is overwritten by \fBPS\fR cookie if set,
and \fBps\fR parameter to \fBs.cgi\fR(1). Less value makes search results
page to appear faster, so don't set it too high.
.IP "\fBClones\fR \fIno\fR"
If this line is present, clones detecting and showing is disabled.
.PP
You can also redefine error messages that are used in cases \fBs.cgi\fR(1)
encounters an error. The following error messages are used.
.IP "\fBER_STOPWORDS\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if only stopwords are used in query.
.IP "\fBER_EXTRASYMBOL\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if some extra symbols were found at the end of query.
.IP "\fBER_EMPTYQUERY\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if the query is empty.
.IP "\fBER_TOOSHORT\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if the pattern is used, and not enough characters are provided
in it. See also the description of \fBMinFixedPatternLength\fR parameter
in \fBsearchd.conf\fR(5).
.IP "\fBER_NOQUOTED\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if unmatched quote was found.
.IP "\fBER_NOPARENTHESIS\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if unmatched parenthesis was found.
.IP "\fBER_NOSEARCHD\fR \fIstring\fR"
Displayed if \fBs.cgi\fR(1) was unable to connect to \fBsearchd\fR(1).
.SH META VARIABLES

they can be used in any template sections. Variables that can be used only
in some sections described in the \fBTEMPLATE SECTIONS\fR below.

.SH TEMPLATE SECTIONS
.TP
\fBtop\fR
This section is included first on every page. So, you should begin this
section with standard HTML preamble: \f(CW<HTML><HEAD>...\fR and so on.
Here in this section you also provide search form.
.PP
The following meta variables are used:
.IP \fB$Q\fR
HTML-escaped search query.
.IP \fB$QF\fR
URL-escaped search query, concatenated with previous query if search was made
within results).
.IP \fB$q\fR

otherwise HTML-escaped search query, concatenated with previous query if
search was made within results).
.IP \fB$A\fR
Argument for FORM ACTION tag with host name and protocol
(example: \f(CWhttp://www.aspseek.com/cgi-bin/s.cgi\fR).

\ <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="t" VALUE="Take me there">
</FORM>
<!--/top-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBbottom\fR
This section is always comes last in every page. So you should provide
all the closing tags which have their counterparts in \fBtop\fR section.
Although it is not obligatory to place this section at the end of
template file, but doing so will help you to view your template as an
ordinary HTML file in a browser to get the idea how it is looks like.
.PP
Example:
.nf
\f(CW<!--bottom-->
</BODY>
</HTML>
<!--/bottom-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBrestop\fR
This section is included just before the search results. It's not a bad
idea to provide some common search results in this section.
You can do so by using the following meta variables: \fB$f\fR, \fB$l\fR,
\fB$t\fR, \fB$W\fR.
.PP
Example:
.nf
\f(CW<!--restop-->
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100%>
<TR>
<TD><small>Matches $f-$l of total <B>$t</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Search took $Y seconds.</TD>
<TD><small>$W</small></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<!--/restop-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBres\fR
.IP \fBres2\fR
These sections are used for displaying various information about every
found document. \fBres\fR is used to display first document for each found
site or for all documents is only 1 site is found (or grouping by sites is
off). \fBres2\fR is used to display second document for each site
if more than 1 site is found.
.PP
The following meta variables are used: \fB$D*\fR (where \fB*\fR is any
character), \fB$CC\fR, \fB$CL\fR.
.PP

</UL>
<!--/res-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBmoreurls\fR
This section is displayed when more than 1 or 2 URLs is found

result just instead of $M2, $M1 or $M meta variables. The following
parameters are used in this section:
.IP \fB$SS\fR
URL of home page of site of found document.
.IP \fB$SH\fR
URL to get more results from this site.
.IP \fB$SC\fR
Total number of documents found on this site.

of \fB$R\fR.
.PP
Example:
.nf
\f(CW<!--resurls-->
Displaying documents $f-$l of total <B>$t</B> found on site $SS.
<!--/resurls-->
.fi
\fR
.SS Excerpts and cached copy highlighting
It is very convenient for user to have query words highlighted in search result
excerpt and in cached copy. This is done using several sections.
.PP
.IP \fBhiopen\fR
.IP \fBhiclose\fR
Used to to highlight the words in "cached" copy. Contents of these sections
are printed before and after the found word.
.IP \fBhiexopen\fR
.IP \fBhiexclose\fR
Used in displaying excerpts, works the same was as \fBhiopen\fR and
\fBhiclose\fR.
.IP \fBexopen\fR
.IP \fBexclose\fR
Contents of this sections are displayed just before and after each excerpt
found.
.IP \fBhicolors\fR
Each line of this section should contain value of color for each search
term. Value of color is taken from line with number equal to N mod C,
where N is the search term sequential number and C is the total number
of lines in this section.
.PP
The following meta variables are used:
.IP \fB$H\fR
String value of color to highlight, taken from "hicolors" templates section.
.PP
Below is an example of highlighting-related sections.
.nf
\f(CW<!--hiopen-->
<B style="color:black;background-color:#$H">

ff66ff
66ffff
ff6666
6666ff
66ff66
<!--/hicolors-->
.fi
\fR
.PP
.SS Clones
Clones are HTML documents with the same contents. \fBASPseek\fR found such
documents by comparing calculated MD5 checksums.
.PP
The following meta variables are used:
.IP \fB$CL\fR
List of clones.
.SS "Cached" pages
The following section names are used to customize the appearance of "cached"
pages (e.g. the pages with page contents stored in ASPseek's database).
.IP \fBcachetop\fR
This section is included first on every "cached" page. The following meta
variables can be used: \fB$DU\fR.
.SS Displaying error messages
The following template sections are used to display various error messages.
.IP \fBnotfound\fR
As its name implies, this section is displayed in case when
no documents are found. You usually give a little message saying that
and maybe some hints how to make search less restrictive.
.PP
Below is an example of notfound section:
.nf
\f(CW<!--notfound-->
Sorry, but search hasn't returned results.<P>
<I>Try to produce less restrictive search query,
or check words spelling</I>.
<!--/notfound-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBerror\fR
This section is displayed in case some internal error occurred while
searching. See the list of errors in description of \fBvariables\fR section.
Use the \fB$E\fR meta variable to print error message text.
.PP
Example of error section:
.nf
\f(CW<!--error-->
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">An error occurred.</FONT><P>
<B>$E</B>
<!--/error-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBqueryerror\fR
This section is displayed in case if query contains error
like unmatched quote or parenthesis. You should use \fB$E\fR meta variable
here.
.PP
Example of error section:
.nf
\f(CW<!--queryerror-->
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Error in query: $E</FONT><P>
<B>$E</B>
<!--/queryerror-->
.fi
\fR
.IP \fBcomplexPhrase\fR
This section is displayed in case if boolean expression is used inside
phrase. Intended just to warn user, and probably give some hints.
.IP \fBcomplexExpression\fR
This section is displayed in case if boolean expression
is used in query. Intended just to warn user, and probably give some hints.
.SS Including a file into template
.IP \fBinclude\fR\ \fIfilename\fR
If line \f(CW<!--include filename -->\fR is encountered, then \fBASPseek
starts loading template definitions from file, specified by \fIfilename\fR,
then resumes processing of current file. Example of use: if two or more
template definitions differ only in \fBtop\fR and \fBbottom\fR sections,
then create one file with sections other than \fBtop\fR and \fBbottom\fR,
then create two different files with \fBtop\fR and \fBbottom\fR sections.
.SS Special OPTION SELECTED substitutions
In order to save the value for option user selected across the different
search result pages, the following "selected magic" hack is used.
\fBs.cgi\fR(1) scans the template for all of <OPTION> tags in <SELECT>
which do have attribute \fBSELECTED\fR followed by \fB=\fR sign and some
value, and removes all of the \fBSELECTED\fR fields with the attribute
different of that in \fBVALUE\fR.
.PP
In the following example the string \f(CWSELECTED\fR will only be presented
in line that have its \f(CWVALUE\fR equal to value of \fB$ps\fR meta variable.
.nf
\f(CW<SELECT NAME="ps">
<OPTION VALUE="10" SELECTED="$ps">10
<OPTION VALUE="20" SELECTED="$ps">20
<OPTION VALUE="50" SELECTED="$ps">50
</SELECT>
.fi
\fR
.SS Defining different output formats
You can have several section with the same name in template. Normally,
the first encountered section is used. This behavior can be overridden by
supplying \fBo\fR=\fIn\fR parameter to \fBs.cgi\fR(1). If value of \fIn\fR
is more than zero, then "\fIn\fR+1"th sections are used. If number of
occurrences of particular section is less then value of "\fIn\fR+1", then
last section with the needed name is used.
.PP
The following meta variables are used:
.IP \fB$o\fR
Substituted with the current value of \fBo\fR parameter of \fBs.cgi\fR(1).
.SS User-defined template sections
Besides the standard template sections, user-defined sections can be used.
\fBs.cgi\fR(1) treats line \f(CW<!--sectionname-->\fR as the start of
user-defined template section and line \f(CW<!--/sectionname-->\fR as the
end of user-defined template. Note that name of section must begin with
alphanumeric character, otherwise this line is treated as regular HTML
comment belonging to the current template section, so it is important to
put space after "<!--" in comments.
.PP
User-defined templates can be used
from other templates with the following meta variable.
.IP \fB$T\fR\fIsectionname\fR
Gets substituted with user-defined template section named \fIsectionname\fR.
.SS Random number generation
This is a feature of \fBs.cgi\fR(1) that allows you to include random numbers
to resulting HTML, for example in order to get a random banner. Numbers are
generated in the range [0; \fImax\fR], where \fImax\fR is equal to value of
\fBRandom\fR\fIN\fR=\fImax\fR in \fBvariables\fR section (see above). So, you put
meta variable \fB$r\fR\fIN\fR, which will be substituted to generated random
number. \fIN\fR should be in the range 0...127, that means you can use up to
128 different random number variables.
.PP
In the example below \fB$r1\fR will be substituted with random number in the range
from 0 to 100, \fB$r2\fR - from 0 to 500.
.PP
.nf
