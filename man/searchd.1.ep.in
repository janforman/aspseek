.SH NAME
searchd \- search daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsearchd\fR \fB-D\fR [\fB-R\fR] [\fB-l\fR \fIlogfile\fR] [\fIconfigfile\fR]
.PP
\fBsearchd\fR \fB-h\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsearchd\fR is a search daemon. Its purpose in ASPseek is to search the
database created by \fBindex\fR(1), cache search results etc.
It listens on a port for \fBs.cgi\fR(1) queries, does the search and returns
results found to \fBs.cgi\fR(1).
.PP
\fBsearchd\fR loads some data from the database to memory to speed up
search. If that data is changed on disk, \fBsearchd\fR reloads it.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-D\fR 10
is used to run \fBsearchd\fR as a daemon. You need it every time you run
\fBsearchd\fR.
.IP \fB-R\fR 10
is used to auto-restart \fBsearchd\fR in case of its failure. So using this
option you will get non-stop search engine.
.IP \fB-F\fR 10
is used when you want to run \fBsearchd\fR with process monitoring
tools like \fBdaemontools\fR. With this option \fBsearchd\fR will not daemonize
and stay in the foreground.
.IP "\fB-l\fR \fIlogfile\fR" 10
sets that \fBsearchd\fR should write its log into specified \fIlogfile\fR.
By default log is written into \f(CW@sysconfdir@/dlog.log\fR.
.IP \fB-h\fR 10
is used to get a help message from \fBsearchd\fR.
.IP \fIconfigfile\fR 10
is the name of configuration file to be read.
Default is \f(CW@sysconfdir@/searchd.conf\fR.

.SH BUGS
If you try to start \fBsearchd\fR, but the port used by it is already in use
by another program (most probably another \fBsearchd\fR), you will not get
error message to console, only to log file. So every time before trying to
start \fBsearchd\fR check that there's no \fBsearchd\fR running, and kill it
if necessary. Or, after starting \fBsearchd\fR, check the log file for errors.
