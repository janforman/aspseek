#
# This scripts fixes inability of configure to expand macros that are
# more than one level deep. Say, you want to put _at_localstatedir_at_
# to your include file, but it will be expanded to _at_prefix_at_/var,
# which is obviously not what you intended. So, run this script on
# resulting include file to fix things. Alternative way is to add
# -DLOCALSTATEDIR=_at_localstatedir_at_ to CFLAGS.
# NOTE: _at_ means @ in above examples.
#
# If somebody knows a better way of doing this, please tell me about it.
